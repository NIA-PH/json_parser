The Calango SRIP in Zamboanguita change the lives of the farmers as they attested that before, the people thereat could hardly afford to eat rice, saying that \"they only eat rice when somebody in the family is sick\".  Completed in 2000, the project had since changed that outlook, saying, they can eat as many times they want. The SRIP enabled the farmers to plant rice at least twice a year and vegetables year round supplying nearby municipalities.<br><br>
With the introduction of organic technology by the Department of Agriculture, they have shifted from chemical to organic fertilizer which their Irrigators Association produced. They attest that organic fertilizer increased their yield to 100-120 cav per ha/cropping season.<br><br>
In Dauin SRIP in the same province, where before, the whole service area of Dauin is purely cogon and scattered with large lava stones all over the place, the area is now beaming with ricefields planted with rice and other crops. One farmer, Mr. Godofredo Tabijon attested that his life improved a lot with the completion of the irrigation system. He plants vegetables, one of which is eggplant. He said that from his 6,000 sq.m. lot, his gross income is about P50,000.00 in three months. He uses organic fertilizer and does not use chemicals for pest and other plant diseases.  He patiently picked out the insects and other destructive elements of plants.<br><br>
These irrigation systems were recently visited by NIA Administrator Nangel and he said that he is very pleased to gather first hand information from the farmers of the benefits they are getting from NIA projects.

The farmers said that organic fertilizer enabled them to harvest 100-120 cavans per hectare. Incidentally, the ALISA Irrigators Association has been a consistent awardee as Most Outstanding IA not only in Region 10 but also a runner-up in the national category. Mayor Giovanni Labis expressed his gratitude for the support NIA is giving to his constituents. In turn, Mayor Labis committed to share in the cost for air drier, which the IA requested from NIA.

The idea of putting up mini-hydro power plants in irrigation systems came up after NIA Administrator Antonio S. Nangel visited Japan, where he saw mini-hydro power plants installed in irrigation canals. He said that while it can be done in Japan, it can also be done in the Philippines where the same elevation of irrigation canals abounds.  Upon his arrival, Administrator Nangel issued Memorandum Circular No. 55 S 2011, to all Regional/Operations Managers of NIA to identify possible sites for mini-hydro power plants in irrigation canals/systems, providing therein guidelines/criteria.<br><br>
Administrator Nangel said that the project would require installation of turbine engine in irrigation canals to turn it into a mini hydro-power plant. &quot;Our irrigation systems are mostly located in far-flung barangays and putting up this project  is a great help to the prospective beneficiaries&quot;, he added.<br><br>
Administrator Nangel is very optimistic that this project will take-off because 12 firms have submitted Letter of Intent (LOI), and targeted sites for development is 22.

He said that NIA has many irrigation canals of the same nature, and if it can be done in Japan, it could also be done in the Philippines.<br><br>
From then on, there is no turning back for Administrator Nangel. He created a Technical Working Group to spearhead the program. Inventories of irrigation canals with potential for mini hydro power plants were conducted in all NIA irrigation canals. To date, there are about 110 potential sites nationwide.<br><br>
This program was brought up to JICA who in turn responded and decided to conduct a Preparatory Survey for Mini-Hydropower Development Project in the Philippines.  Meetings between NIA and JICA ensued until a Minutes of Discussion was completed and agreed upon. Hence, on July 31, 2012, NIA and JICA signed the Minutes of Discussion as a signal to proceed with the preliminary survey.<br><br>
The blueprint for the project is set from 2012 to the first quarter of 2015. But Administrator Nangel requested that the project should be completed by 2014.

In a short message delivered by Secretary Alcala, he said that the MOA signing is a concrete manifestation of collaboration and maximized utilization of resources by various agencies to give joy to the people especially those in the countryside.  Along this line, he instructed NIA Administrator Nangel to identify possible sites in Mindanao and to submit to him the list not later than the end of this month (November).  He said that these hydropower plant projects in Mindanao are great help in that area because they have been experiencing intermittent power shortages.<br><br>
On the part of NIA Administrator Nangel, he initially thank the Secretary for the support in this undertaking.

He said that there are about 150 sites already validated nationwide for hydropower plants and identification of sites for potable water is ongoing.<br><br>
DOE Secretary Petilla said that the MOU / MOA signing is very significant in that our country have been looking for sources of electricity, and these projects once completed will provide electricity at a very low cost.<br><br>

Department of Agriculture Secretary Proceso J. Alcala led other guests in the inauguration of the Iwahig Penal-Balsahan Irrigation Project in Puerto Princesa.  Said irrigation project which is located within the property of the penal colony was constructed and completed in five (5) months. Total project cost of P40 M, it will irrigate about 414 hectares.
<br><br>
Unlike other NIA Projects, the Iwahig Irrigation Project was constructed with labor force provided by the inmates of the Penal Colony.  They were such good and efficient construction workers that the project was completed ahead of schedule.  The inmates were also very grateful for the opportunity given them to work on the project as this will give them income to meet their personal needs.
<br><br>
In a dialogue between Secretary Alcala, Bureau of Corrections Director General Gaudencio Pangilinan, NIA Administrator Antonio S. Nangel agreed to introduce other programs within the Iwahig Penal Colony to make the inmates productive once they get out from Iwahig Penal Colony.
<br><br>
Secretary Alcala was impressed by which the irrigation project was completed because it would mean additional area for production. He said, we are on the right track of achieving our rice self-sufficiency goal.  For his part, NIA Administrator acknowledged the support and cooperation of the officials of the Iwahig Penal Colony, the LGU and vowed to continue supporting irrigation development in the province of Palawan.
<br><br>
According to BuCor Director Pangilinan, the harvest from the irrigated area will be enough to sustain about 3,000 employees and inmates in the colony. They practice progressive farming in that, some portions of the irrigated area is under land preparation/transplanting, normal irrigation and harvesting. The colony can be described as a self-sustaining community because it also boost of inland fishponds where they grow tilapia; vegetables garden, livestocks, fruit trees and other source of food.<br><br>

\"Para makita kung talagang nagtatrabaho ang head of office\", is the response of Engr. Claro V. Maranan, newly installed Administrator of the National Irrigation Administration during a live interview at Net 25 when he was asked what could be the reason why the appointment of an administrator is good for one year only and subject to renewal.  Administrator Maranan further said, \"it could be less than one year\".
<br><br>
Asked about the status of Balog-balog Dam, Maranan explained that the project was already presented and approved on August 5, 2013 by the Cabinet Committee Investment Coordination Committee and now ready for indorsement to NEDA Board. Once approved, procurement can be started and target for completion is May 2016.  The project costing P15.8 B will serve 4 cities and 8 municipalities covering about 34,100 hectares benefitting 23,000 farmers in the province of Tarlac.  The approved scheme is the construction of the high dam.  Aside from irrigation, hydropower and flood control mitigation are also its components.
<br><br>
On the issue of 100% funds already released to NIA, but the accomplishment is only 60%, Administrator Maranan explained that there are cases wherein contractors have not billed NIA or the project is not yet completed. In either case, NIA do not disburse funds, hence, the funds are still intact with NIA coffers. \"Hindi nawawala ang pondo\", he said.
<br><br>
Other major project that is ongoing is the Jalaur River Multipurpose Project in Iloilo that will serve 2 cities and 23 municipalities covering about 31,840 ha benefitting 24,000 farmers. This project will also serve sugarcane areas. Jalaur project has also a hydropower component.
<br><br>
On the other hand, evaluation of the Balintingon Project in Nueva Ecija is ongoing, and once completed, feasibility study will be started.  He also informed the anchormen that there are potential projects in Quezon which he ordered investigation and validation for inclusion in future years because listing of projects for 2014 was already finalized.
<br><br>
When asked what should be done to attain the objective in 2016, Maranan said that his program is focused on rapid delivery of irrigation projects. One of the steps to be taken to achieve this is to increase the authority of the regional office from P40M to P100M to fast track project implementation.
<br><br>
Maranan also explained that rice requirement is about 20 M metric tons. At the moment, ASec Dante Delima informed that we have attained 19 M MT already, so, by the end of 2013, the 20M MT rice requirement is already attained.
<br><br>
On the hot issue of PDAF, Achorman Congressman Dante Marcoleta asked whether NIA is also involved.  Maranan said that there are also PDAF coursed through NIA but these are channeled to the LGU.
<br><br>
On how Administrator Maranan maintains the trust and confidence of the President, he said that as Civil Engineer \"tinututukan ko ang project implementation, and I will see to that all projects will be completed on time\".
<br><br>
In closing Administrator Maranan assured the people especially the farmers that NIA will continue to perform its mandate, \"maasahan po ninyo and patuloy na paglilingkod ng NIA tungo sa progresibong Pilipinas\". He also gave his cellular phone number so that anybody can call or text him for any assistance needed.","date_published": "2013-08-07","time_published": "02:08:00","date_closed": "2013-12-31"}, {"news_id": 60,"source_id": "B70MQSTT017","source_site": "","publishedBy": "","title": "BALOG-BALOG DAM GETS APPROVAL OF CABCOM-ICC","forpncicid": "No","content": "<br>

<br><br>
The NIA Administrator said that he, together with the other government agencies, will also do all that they can to solve and help the Bugkalot Confederation. &quot;The Bugkalot Confederation has a legitimate claim that&rsquo;s why they agreed to the project,&quot; Maranan added.

National Irrigation Administration (NIA) chief Claro V. Maranan discussed the details of the NIA&rsquo;s Infrastructure Program during the General Membership Meeting of The Philippines Constructors&rsquo; Association Inc. last September 27, 2013 at Discovery Suites, Ortigas Center in Pasig City.
<br><br>
The NIA administrator was invited to the said event as guest speaker where he talked about the agency&rsquo;s approach to meet all its irrigation targets for the year 2013.<br><br>
He laid out his Seven Point Program as NIA&rsquo;s approach composed of rapid delivery of irrigation projects; rectification of irrigation data inputs&rsquo; organizational reform; corporate financial stability; empowerment of NIAns; better working conditions and environment; comprehensive climate change program for irrigation; and stronger commitment to farmers for lasting cooperation and partnership.<br><br>
Based on his program the administrator was able to finish the rectification of data in two months time and requested the board to allow regions who have capability to implement, design and to bid the projects to fast track the implementation of projects.
<br><br>
He also plans to make NIA a viable corporation through new programs such as power generation through mini-hydro plants. The agency has identified 160 sites and has talked with investors so that in the future, NIA would be able to earn more revenue from the power generation.
<br><br>
In terms of people empowerment, Maranan also emphasized the need for contractors to be more committed and support each other for the faster delivery of services. In terms of Climate Change, he plans on using more durable materials that would last longer and cut down on maintenance cost.
<br><br>
&quot;I think we can do better in our construction through proper implementation of the project. We should also be partners with the contractors because we need their dedication, capability and commitment so that we can deliver our services to the country,&quot; Maranan said.
<br><br>
He laso mentioned that there are new projects undertaken by NIA such as the Jalaur project that will be completed in 2016 and will generate there dams powered by 6.6 megawatt hydro-power plant and an 81-kilometer highline canal expected to benefit 10 villages and the Balog-Balog composed of one big dam and three small dams which will benefit 23,000 farmers and to generate 73,100 jobs.

In the wake of the damage caused by &quot;Typhoon Yolanda&quot;, National Irrigation Administration chief Claro V. Maranan has mobilized the agency&rsquo;s management and employees to donate relief goods such as food, clothing, blankets and other materials to the victims of the typhoon during the flag-raising ceremony last Monday on November 11, 2013.
<br><br>
&quot;I saw the condition that the people were in and they really need all the help that they can get,&quot; Maranan said.
<br><br>
The mobilization is part of the NIA&rsquo;s efforts to help the victims of the recent storms, many of whom were left without food, clothing and shelter, and are now in need of aid. The Administrator with the help of The Management, Employees&rsquo; Association and Irrigators&rsquo; Association has tapped the Public Affairs and Information Staff (PAIS) to receive items for donation and tasked to handle the packing and transfer of the donated goods that will be done at the NIA Multi-purpose Gymnasium. The items will be given to the victims of the typhoon.
<br><br>
Apart from organizing a donation drive, the administrator has also submitted initial report of the typhoon damages to the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the Office of the President regarding the irrigation sites affected. As of November 12, a total of 12,093 hectares were affected in Regions 4-A, 4-B, 5, 6, 7, 10 and 13.
<br><br>
Crop damaged in the said regions amounted to P88,563,200 while cost of repairs to be done to irrigation facilities came to P300,029,214. Damaged facilities were 31 canal structures, 39 small dams and the number of farmers affected by the recent calamity totaled to 9,390.
<br><br>
The Administrator also pledge to help the farmers whom he considers partners of the NIA to rebuild areas that were devastated by Typhoon Yolanda. &quot;Bukod sa mga calamity fund na ibibigay ng NIA at ng ating pamahalaan, mag-aallocate tayo ng P150M out of our budget from 2014 para matulungan po natin ang mga affected areas&quot;, Maranan added.

Administrator Claro V. Maranan, who viewed the activity as a very 'significant event for the agency,' led the National Irrigation Administration in launching the agency's newest foreign funded project, the National Irrigation Sector Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (NISRIP), together with representatives from the Japan International Cooperation Association (JICA) and Philippine Rice Research Institute (JICA). NIA officials from the central and field offices, employees, and other guests watched as the JICA-funded initiative was placed into the limelight at the IEC Auditorium within the NIA Compound on November 19, 2013.
<br><br>
After Deputy Administrator Modesto G. Membreve welcomed the audience in this significant event in NIA, Acting Project Manager, Engr. John Celeste, proudly introduced the project as a complete 5-year intervention to increase the productivity of around 22,563 farmer-beneficiaries from nine different regions nationwide, covering a total service area of 35,670 hecatares, through rehabilitation and restoration of systems, provision of consultancy and institutional development activities as well as giving operation and maintenance equipment, and other agricultural support services.
<br><br>
Senior Deputy Administrator Felix M. Razo, in his message as a strong advocate of NIA-IA partnership, mentioned that the NISRIP is a recognition of the importance of Irrigators Associations in NIA's project implementation. He also believes that NISRIP is one of NIA's means to realize not just the agency's vision of becoming a dynamic and viable government corporation but also to improve the socio-economic status of farmers.
<br><br>
Also gracing the event were the representatives of NIA's partners in the implementation of the project - JICA and PHILRICE. Sachiko Takeda, the Senior Representative of JICA, reminded for a close coordination among the involved agencies to ensure the synergy of project components towards inclusive growth and optimal results. Dr. Aurora Corrales of PHILRICE on the other hand challenged NIA to ensure that NISRIP is not just a project with a perfect plan but should also be implemented as it was perfectly designed.
<br><br>
Before the NISRIP marker was unveiled, Deputy Administrator for Administrative and Finance Lorna Grace B. Rosario closed the program saying that &quot;NISRIP is another force for the realization of NIA's objectives, mission, and vision with the cooperation of the strengthened Irrigators Association. &quot;

The National Irrigation Administration (NIA) will utilize its machineries and equipment to help repair irrigation systems that were affected by the recent onslaught of Typhoon \"Yolanda\" that occurred last November 2013. The use of the said equipment is part of NIA's on-going efforts to restore irrigation services to avert further damage to crops.
<br><br>
NIA Administrator Claro V. Maranan reported that he had made an inventory of the agency's equipment and found that the agency has 95 heavy equipment and 88 light equipment that can be used for repairs and were sent to the affected areas (Region 4-A, 4-B, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 13).

<br><br>
Apart from the use of its equipment, the Administrator further reports that NIA plans to allocate P140,000,000 from its 2014 budget for the Irrigation sites, specially those who are always hit by typhoons.
<br><br>
Further, employees of the agency were also mobilized to raise relief goods by donating goods such as food, clothing, blankets and other materials last November 11, 2013. NIA Public Affairs and Information Staff (PAIS) head Ms. Pilipina P. Bermudez reported that the donated goods for NIA-Region VII have been loaded to state trucks coming from MARIIS, CAR and Region III and delivered to Tacloban last Saturday. The trucks left at 3:00 am Sunday and arrived at Naga City at 2:00 pm, their first stop over.
<br><br>
The trucks later travelled to Albay to rendezvous with the stake truck coming from Project Manager Estelita S. Sumile of HCAAP-Northern Samar. That will carry construction materials that were bought in the area. The use of the relief trucks were ferried free via Bulan going to Tacloban where it would be met NIA regional employees.
<br><br>
Initially, donations remitted to the Central Office were released to NIA Region VI amounting to P200,000 while P300,000 was released to NIA Region V to take charge in the purchase of construction materials and other utilities that people need in Region VIII. She further states that Administrator Maranan advised that it will be a continuing endeavor until they are able to recover from damage caused by Yolanda.
<br><br>
Apart from the progress made in the relied effort, the Administrator added that NIA is currently finalizing proposal to be submitted to the World Bank Mission funding the Participatory Irrigation development Project (PIDP) to realign the amount of $10,000,000 to address the facilities that were damaged by the typhoon. He further stated that World Bank has rated the agency Satisfactory for showing great improvement in the implementation of PIDP projects.

National Irrigation Administration (NIA) chief Claro V. Maranan has conceptualized and formulated the guidelines and principles of his Seven Point Program that he earlier introduced upon assuming his post as administrator to outline the agency's immediate course of action on various aspects of organizational and operational performance.
<br><br>
The objectives of the said program are the following: 1. Provide creative and speedy solutions to the urgent problems confronting NIA; 2.

<br><br>
The new irrigation facilities that were constructed at the cost of P30,240,000 consisting of dams, canals and canal structures will supply water to a new area of 270 hectares and will supplement the existing 2,100 hectares of farmland and will benefit more or less 1,200 farmers. The Badagoy Irrigators Association, Inc. was a 2012 Agri Pinoy Awardee for irrigation systems management according to RIM Julius S. Maquiling.
<br><br>
On his speech, the administrator said that he was pleased with the association for actively working with barangay officials and the NIA and it was due to this close coordination that contributed to the success of the agency's project in the area.
<br><br>
\"We were not able to complete our projects without the help of the farmers, the barangay, and the local government,\" Maranan said.
<br><br>
He added that NIA is studying the implementation of aquaculture projects as a source of livelihood for farmers and said that the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) will assist them on this matter. Other potential livelihood project that the agency is studying is power generation through the use of hydro-power because there are 160 potential sites in the country where this could be utilized.
<br><br>
Apart from the said event, Maranan also formed and headed \"Task Force Pablo\" a team that proceeded to Region XI in Davao City last December 27 to 30, 2013 to look into the progress of the projects implemented related to Typhoon Pablo.

Acting Regional Manager Ali S. Satol belies claims that the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) irrigation canal of the Siluay-Buayan River Irrigation Systems located at General Santos City was to be blamed for the recent flooding that hit Baluan, Lagao, San Isidro, Bula, and Mabuhay in that city.
<br><br>
The increased dependence on irrigation canal has not been without its negative environmental effect. It proved right when the water, during heavy downpour, from the mountains surrounding Gensan directly goes to the rivers feeding Siluay River Irrigation System and Buayan River Irrigation System dams which then pass through irrigation canals overflowed because these canals are designed for irrigation.
<br><br>
There are no drainage canals in the city so all the water coming from the mountains traverse irrigation canals, and these are not big enough to accommodate all the water crossing. Acting RM Satol added that NIA irrigation canals did not cause the flooding per se. It is then highly recommended that if there is a drainage master plan of the local government then it should be implemented soon.
<br><br>
Every time the rain falls, the protocol was that the gatekeeper opens the sluice gate to allow the water going to the canals and to avoid damage to irrigation structures.
<br><br>
Likewise, during high tide, water from Sarangani Bay enters the vicinity and with this NIA suggests constructing pumping stations to control flooding.
<br><br>
Lastly, Acting RM Satol recommended that NIA and local government officials walk-thru the area during heavy rains to see the actual situation and craft possible solutions to prevent flooding in the future.

In its Consolidated Yearend Report, the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) under the leadership of Administrator Claro V. Maranan reports that it generated a total revenue of P4.0453 billion in CY 2013, an increase of P492 million compared to P3.5535 billion in CY 2012.
<br><br>
Based on the Financial Performance Report from the Deputy Administrator for Administrative and Finance Lorna Grace B. Rosario dated March 20, 2014, the significant increase in revenue by the Agency was credited to the improved collection of Irrigation Service Fees (ISF) of P204 million (P1.4456 billion in CY 2012 to P1.6478 billion in CY 2013); decrease in 10% discount on ISF of P2 million and increase in loss on sale of palay P.122 million; increase of P197 million in Subsidy income from the National Government, specifically in 5% Management Fee (P984.36 million CY 2012 and P1.187 billion in CY 2013 less decrees of P5.5 million in Management Fee.
<br><br>
Other factors were the increase of P12 million for CIP/CIS/Pump Amortization and Equity; increase of P75 million in Water Fees and Energy Delivery Fees; increase of P12 million in Rent Income and Penalties; increase of P7 million in Miscellaneous and other fines and penalties and decrease in interest income of P15 million.
<br><br>
The increase was also due to the Agency's on-going effort to attain financial viability through the dedication and perseverance of regional directors, project and irrigation managers and all NIA officials and employees who worked hard towards attaining targets, collection and remittance of irrigation fees.
<br><br>
The expected dividend to be remitted to the Bureau of Treasury is P17,010,429.66. The final amount of dividend is computed based on the Audited Income Statement as prescribed under the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act 7656, An Act Requiring Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) to Declare Dividends to the National Government. The last time the NIA was able to remit dividends was in 2009.

Barely a week after the appointment of Hon. Florencio F. Padernal as NIA administrator, he surprised the farmers and NIA employees in Negros Occidental by his unannounced visit where he demonstrated a fast-paced and more responsive NIA services.
<br><br>
Armed only with a camera, tablet and stored  knowledge and experiences, the Administrator squeezed his time and attended a dialogue with the farmers, inspected the Bago River Irrigation System, participated in the Pre-Construction Conference, visited a communal irrigation system and conducted a meeting with the contractors.
<br><br>
The productive dialogue with the farmers yield optimism. The administrator noted the farmers concerns on poorly maintained irrigation roads, delayed repair of damages caused by typhoons, excessive water conveyance losses due to earth canals and the threats on water shortage due to water permit applications of private persons to draw water from Bago River.  These concerns were put in writing and hand carried by the administrator who traveled alone.
<br><br>
As an engineer himself, the administrator quickly noted interventions that should be done to further improve the delivery of services when he personally inspected the irrigation systems.  He said, he would include in his targets the installation of CCTVs in major dams across the country for efficient monitoring particularly during floods and droughts.
<br><br>
A down to earth public service was demonstrated when Engr. Padernal stood from his chair an assist in posting of visual aids during the pre-construction conference for the Maragandang Augmentation project participated by the local officials, irrigators' associations, project contractor and other irrigation stakeholders. He engaged the commitment of the attendees to closely monitor the project and report immediately any irregularity that they may observe.
<br><br>
The contractors were advised to hasten project construction, otherwise NIA will impose necessary measures.  The administrator promised to return within 60 days and personally assess the progress of work.  Before he depart, Engr. Padernal congratulated Engr. Lorena B. Sioco, Officer-in-Charge of Negros Occidental Irrigation Management Office and Ms. Rosemary R. Caunca, President of League of Federation of Irrigators Association for the cohesive team work of NIA, LGUs and the farmers through their Irrigators' Associations.","date_published": "2014-07-11","time_published": "15:45:16","date_closed": "2014-12-31"}, {"news_id": 93,"source_id": "B70MQSTT017","source_site": "","publishedBy": "","title": "NIA CHIEF VISITS PROJECT SITES","forpncicid": "No","content": "In line with his aim to fast-track project implementation to increase the country's irrigated areas, NIA Administrator Florencio F.

On his July 26, 2014 visit, during the MARIIS celebration of the National Irrigation Administration's 51st Anniversary and awarding ceremony of the system's top performers, Sec. Pangilinan commended MARIIS Operations Manager Mariano G. Dancel for including the farmers' income in his presentation.
<br><br>
He said that most presentations he had seen so far only include irrigated areas, equipment, fund allocation and it was the first time that the farmers' income was reported.
<br><br>
\"While NIA focuses on increasing the area of irrigated lands, it must always be in tandem with increasing the farmers' income,\" he added.
<br><br>
He said having 3-4 harvests a year does not matter if our farmers earn the same and continue to live a hard life.  He shared what his then 9-year old daughter told him that we should treat farmers the same way we treat our parents because they are the ones feeding us.
<br><br>
He said that some farmers are over 50 years old and they are earning an average income of P23,000 a year and it is sad how they are preyed upon by bogus farmer organizations and foundations.
<br><br>
He said that the Philippine would not be able to establish a progressive economy with a sustainable growth if we could not increase the income of our farmers.
<br><br>
Sec. Pangilinan said this is the strategy the PAFSAM is adapting to be able to provide real support to improve the lives of the Filipino farmers.
<br><br>
NIA Administrator Florencio F. Padernal, who also graced the occasion, called on farmers to provide NIA officials feedback so it could work effectively and efficiently in delivering irrigation services.

This will eventually contribute in the National Irrigation Agency (NIA)'s efforts in increasing rice production in the country.
<br><br>
The Patanad Diversion Dam, which was inaugurated on April 23, 2014, reuses water from Quitabayag Creek that traverses Barangay Patanad to irrigate 200 hectares of farmland that were previously used mostly for corn. The construction of the diversion dam sparked hope among corn farmers who wanted to shift to rice and to those with farmlands in elevated areas.

Part of the project is the construction of the Patanad Pumping Station, which was opened on June 26, 2014, that would irrigate about 250 hectares in four barangays namely Patanad, Camarag, Gomez, and Do&ntilde;a Paulina. It started irrigating 115 hectares of rice land for wet crop 2014 and the rest of the benefitted area will be irrigated on the next cropping season once lands have been converted from corn to rice farming. Prior to the pump system, farmers have been using their own diesel-powered pumps.
<br><br>
Magat River Integrated Irrigation System (MARIIS) Operations Manager Engr. Mariano G. Dancel said that the presence of the project signals the beginning of a more progressive agricultural economy in the municipality. As of December 2013, MARIIS had been irrigating 60% of agricultural lands in the municipality and the construction of the project will surely increase irrigated areas.
<br><br>
Farmer-beneficiaries, as well as local government officials, expressed their gratitude to NIA because of the positive impact of the project to the municipality. San Isidro Mayor Rey Socrates L. Velasco said the project will surely improve the lives of farmers who have long been waiting for irrigation. Barangay Patanad chief Virgilio Castillo on the other hand said that the construction of the diversion dam was the happiest event held in their barangay and that it will truly change their lives.

Engr. Dancel, speaking on behalf of NIA Administrator Florencio F. Padernal, said that farmers could count on the agency to look for more lands to irrigate as it is NIA's mandate and to provide farmers with improved irrigation service. - with reports from Melissa C. Agbisit, NIA-MARIIS PRO

Administrator Florencio F. Padernal, DPA was set to inspect major projects in Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay, and Zamboanga del Norte during his two-day visit. He was accompanied by Department Manager for Public Affairs and Information Staff, Pilipina P. Bermudez.
<br><br>
<b>Project Inspections</b>
<br><br>
Engr. Padernal started his project inspection by visiting proposed irrigation projects with flood-control needs. First was in Salug River Irrigation System (SARIS) in Molave, Zamboanga del Sur where he was briefed on the effect of climate change particularly on the flooding of its service area affecting 1,450 hectares out of its 7,809-ha service area. The same issues of flooding that affects irrigation and the need of drainage facilities were presented to him in his visit to Sibuguey Valley Irrigation System (SVIS) in Titay, Zamboanga Sibugay, Dipolo River Irrigation System (DRIS) in Dumingag, Zamboanga del Sur, and Titay Small Reservoir Irrigation Project (Titay SRIP).
<br><br>
The flood-control components of the projects - which are scheduled for Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering in 2015 - are covered by the convergence program of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) led by Secretary Rogelio L. Singson. The convergence program was initiated as a holistic approach to solve problems confronting irrigation and flood control that affect productivity in irrigated areas.
<br><br>
The Administrator also visited two major on-going projects in Zamboanga del Norte namely: Lagag SIP, a new irrigation project located in Lagag, Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte with a service area of 120 hectares with 85 farmer-beneficiaries; and, 92%-completed Sindangan CIS located in Brgy. Labakid, Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte covering a service area of 425 hectares with 450 famer-beneficiaries which is set to be finished in the later part of the year.
<br><br>
<b>Acknowledging IAs and Employees</b>
<br><br>
As important part of his field visit, he also met with NIA employees and Irrigators Association (IA) presidents to personally present his strategic directions to achieve the agency's goals. He highlighted his vision for a holistic development of the agency, employing a multi-disciplinary approach to project implementation and management.
<br><br>
He highlighted the importance of a strengthened partnership between the farmers through the IAs and NIA. He also encouraged young professionals to beef-up their knowledge and skills to become future leaders of NIA.
<br><br>
NIA Region 9 Manager Engr. Diosdado R. Rosales assured ENgr. Padernal that the region together with the farmers is performing and helping the administration achieve its goals.
<br><br>
<b>LGU Partnerships</b>
<br><br>
Engr. Padernal also met with LGU officials in the region to discuss how they can pull their resources together to solve the irrigation needs of the region as well as the perennial flooding in Zamboanga Sibugay and Zamboanga del Norte. He first met with District II Congresswoman Ann K. Hofer of Zamboanga Sibugay to discuss irrigation plans in the province. He also met Governor Tony Cerilles of Zamboanga del Sur and Congresswoman Aurora Cerilles upon return to Pagadian City. Administrator Padernal also met the Congressman of the 2nd District of Zamboanga del Norte, Hon. Rosendo S. Labadlbad, before returning to Manila.
<br><br>
<b>'Light at the end of the tunnel'</b>
<br><br>
In his message during the inauguration of the newly-completed NIA IX office and training center, Administrator Padernal summoned cooperation among employees, managers, and farmers alike to help him in solving the problems of the agency. He appealed to everyone to do their share in fast-tracking implementation of projects programmed in 2015 more so the carryover projects of the past years. He also intends to conduct workshops and fora among farmer stakeholders of NIA as one of the preparations of his 10-year master plan for irrigation. Padernal, who is now on his third month in office, assured the region that good things are coming to NIA. His introduction to new strategies in the entire project implementation and other organizational reforms being done now were just few of the tenets of his administration.

\"I am a performer, I produce,\" he further stated, aiming to motivate the Region 8 NIAns in doing their part efficiently.
<br><br>
Just like his visits in other regions, Engr. Padernal immediately proceeded with his project site inspection together with NIA-8 Regional Manager Romeo G. Quiza. Their team visited Sta. Rita Small Reservoir Irrigation Project (Sta. Rita SRIP) in Western Samar where he expressed his satisfaction with the physical accomplishment of the project but also encouraged fast-tracking to complete it before 2017. The team then visited Binahaan River Irrigation System (BRIS) back in Tacloban to check on the Bangon 3 Retention Pool that started operating during the 1st Cropping Season of 2014.
<br><br>
<b>PAFSAM attends IA Presidents Forum</b>
<br><br>
The second day of Padernal's field visit was highlighted by the arrival of Presidential Assistant for Food Security and Agricultural Modernization (PAFSAM) Secretary Francis N. Pangilinan as they both attended the IA Presidents Forum at the Patio Victoria, San Jose, Tacloban. Also with them was Leyte Vice Governor Carlo Loreto.
<br><br>
In his message to the employees, Pangilinan underlined the importance of farmers to NIA. \"It is because of the farmers that is why NIA exists, so we have to give our best effort to improve their lives,\" he said. \"Kung mahal mo ang trabaho mo, mamahalin mo rin ang mga magsasaka,\" he added.
<br><br>
It was also the message Pangilinan enunciated during the forum where he and Padernal handed out awards to the CY 2013 Most Outstanding Irrigators Associations, namely: Matando IA of Hindang-Hilongos RIS (NIS Category) and Hingatungan IA, Inc., Silago, Southern Leyte (CIS Category).
<br><br>
Pangilinan further emphasized the importance of farmers in his message. \"We should move away from subsistence farming to a sustainable, viable farming.  Irrigation is critical, without irrigation we cannot accomplish food security and IAs play a crucial role and we will give support to improve the quality of life of our clients,\" he said.

Padernal and the provincial government of Nueva Ecija headed by Governor Aurelio M. Umali hosted this year's Nueva Ecija Water Summit on October 15, 2014 at the Nueva Ecija Convention Center, this city. The activity primarily aimed to present the current water situation in the coverage area of Upper Pampanga River Integrated Irrigation System (UPRIIS) - headed by Engr. Reynaldo D. Puno - to base the formulation of measures that would help to mitigate the negative effects of the El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon.
<br><br>
<b>El Ni&ntilde;o</b>
<br><br>
PAG-ASA forecasted that the climate phenomenon, which occurs across the tropical Pacific Ocean, will peak during the last quarter of 2014 until beginning of second quarter of 2015. This particular climate pattern is mostly associated with lack of rainfall occurrence, drought, and abnormal weather conditions. Countries that are dependent on agriculture and fisheries like the Philippines are said to be the most affected by El Ni&ntilde;o. Due to this event, rice and food production will likely to suffer.
<br><br>
<b>Affected Area</b>
<br><br>
Currently, Pantabangan Dam had been suffering the initial effects of the phenomenon. Due to the lack of rainfall occurrence, particularly in Luzon, the water elevation of the reservoir as of July 2014 is only at 182 meters. Based on the average and maximum inflows, the projected water level on November 30 is 194.22 meters (average inflow) or 209.53 (maximum inflow) which is still below the Operation Rule Curve of 212.15 meters.
<br><br>
In connection to this, it is forecasted that only 70% or 80,842 hectares out of UPRIIS's total irrigable area of 114,490 hectares can be programmed for irrigation for the Dry Cropping Season 2015 that will affect 27,332 farmers.
<br><br>
<b>Convergence</b>
<br><br>
Also one of the main purposes of the water summit is to convene the stakeholders involved in rice and food production in the province. It became the venue for all the participants to share trends and practices in relation to increasing agricultural productivity amidst the El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon. Aside from Padernal, Umali, and Puno, present during the summit were: DOST-PAGASA Administrator Dr. Vicente B. Malano; Department of Agriculture Asst. Regional Director Cris Bautista; and Representative of the OPAFSAM Ferdinand Hombrebueno. Also present were representatives from other private and government agencies, LGUs, and officials and members of Irrigators Associations (IAs).

Funded by JICA, the hydro-power facility is constructed along Lateral, District 2 of the NIA-Magat River Integrated Irrigation System (MARIIS) here. The newly inaugurated facility can benefit 45 households with an individual consumption of 1000 watts.
<br><br>
NIA Administrator Florencio F. Padernal, Department of Energy Undersecretary Zenaida Y. Monsada, and JICA Senior Representative of the Economic Growth Section Eigo Azukizawa led the switching-on ceremony of the demonstration project which started construction in March and was completed in October this year.
<br><br>
Padernal said that although the new mini-hydropower is not as big as what others expect, the significance of the project is enormous. \"NIA would like to replicate such projects in other areas.  That is one of the reasons why all our irrigation managers from the different regions are here,\" he said.
<br><br>
The NIA Administrator said that secondary to irrigation, the agency operates and implements hydropower projects in applicable areas. \"In fact, we are planning to bid out over 50 new hydro power projects of various capacities around the Philippines the soonest possible time,\" he shared.
<br><br>
Undersecretary Monsada said the residents in the community where the facility is located will now have better access to energy.
<br><br>
The first of its kind in the country, the project shows that it is viable to utilize existing irrigation canals even with small water heads for power generation.
<br><br>
The NIA-MARIIS, through its Division II office, will be operating and maintaining the new facility.

The initiative is seen to increase the storage capacity of the MARIS reservoir by up to eight million cubic meters that will primarily improve the delivery of irrigation water to a larger area of farm lands. NIA-Magat River Integrated Irrigation System (NIA-MARIIS) Operations Manager Mariano G. Dancel shared that with the optimization project, irrigating the whole service area of 85,000 hectares would be possible.
<br><br>
NIA Administrator Florencio F. Padernal said the project is a clear manifestation of a real, effective, efficient private-public partnership.  \"Increasing storage water capacity of the MARIS reservoir is laudable as it denotes water security for peaking hours and saves water in cases of abnormal weather condition or in times of crisis as well as increased power generation,\" he added.
<br><br>
SNAP-Magat Executive Director Danny de Guzman, on the other hand, noted that the project is an example of collective work between NIA and SNAP. \"These collaborative projects are underpinned by not only technical expertise between NIA and SNAP but also the strength of the partnership that we've forged over the past seven years,\" he added.
<br><br>
The project will also provide flexibility for power generation. This could potentially add up 7.75 megawatts of additional capacity for the Luzon grid.
<br><br>
The project is seen to start January next year and is expected to be completed in 2016.

Padernal took on the lead in clearing the path to resolve issues regarding the tribe's claims.
<br><br>
Two major issues raised by the tribe, led by Mayor of Nagtipunan, Quirino and Bugkalot Chieftain Rosario K. Camma, include the percentage share of the tribe from the gross income derived from CalEnergy Power Plant's power generation and at least 10% environmental release from the dam weirs from Casecnan and Taan Rivers.
<br><br>
According to a statement from the Bugkalot Confederation dated November 18, 2014, the 10% environmental water release from dam weirs required as per NWRB Resolution 01-0901 dated September 24, 2001 was ignored resulting to the drying up of the Casecnan and Taan rivers thus affecting the aquatic resources of the rivers and sacrificing the livelihood of many Bugkalot tribesmen.
<br><br>
Nueva Vizcaya Lone District Representative Carlos M. Padilla added that the the most expensive fish in the country, the ludong, started to disappear in the Casecnan River. \"All the water goes to Casecnan in Nueva Ecija affecting other localities and creating 'social problems' that push the people to seek help from local politicians,\" he added.
<br><br>
To address the issues, Dr. Padernal pushed that a timeline of events be prepared and submitted before the year ends to retrace the history of the issues between NIA, CalEnergy, CMIPP, and the Bugkalot tribe. He tapped the NCIP to submit and collate the documents related to the issue to establish an objective history.
<br><br>
Also, the NIA Administrator emphasized on the importance of a convergence meeting among the agencies concerned and stakeholders in January 2015 to create a comprehensive and doable action plan that will address the issues on the project.

<b>Bued # 1: Everything is God's purpose</b>
<br><br>
Bued #1 serves four barangays of Rosario, namely Tay-ac, Camp-one, Subusub, and Tabtabungao with 343 IA members as beneficiaries. NIA La Union Acting Division Manager Gaudencio M. de Vera explained that before Typhoon Pepeng damaged a big portion of the irrigation system in 2009, Bued #1 irrigates 250 hectares. After the restoration, repair and rehabilitation efforts amidst lack of funding, it presently irrigates 300 hectares.
<br><br>
In his emotional acceptance speech, IA President Jun Petina said that everything is God's purpose. They may have experienced hardships for several years, now, they have this irrigation operation back-a blessing in disguise having added 50 hectares to its original firmed-up area.
<br><br>
Second District Representative Eufranio Eriguel on the other hand paid tribute to the farmers who produce food to be served in our dining tables. In addition to that, Board Member Bellarmin Flores II encouraged them to improve their production with the help of the turned-over irrigation project for the consumers who will drop-by the municipality after the Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway (TPLEX) ends in their town.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, NIA Spokesperson and Public Affairs and Information Staff (PAIS) Department Manager Pilipina P. Bermudez, representing NIA Administrator Florencio F. Padernal as guest speaker, told the audience that what Administrator Padernal and Sec. Francis Pangilinan have always wanted that the farmers' income to increase resulting from irrigation. She also added that increasing yield is not the sole indication, but improved living condition of farmers due to irrigation is what is desired.
<br><br>
With positive perspective, Bermudez and NIA Region I Manager John N. Celeste challenged the IA to regain their triumph as one of the most outstanding IAs in the entire Philippines after bagging second in the year 2007 when the irrigation was not yet damaged.
<br><br>
<b>Tumapoc CIS: Changing lives thru irrigation</b>
<br><br>
On the other hand, Tumapoc CIS, a NIA-CARP-IC project in coordination with the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) and Japan International Cooperative Agency (JICA) under ARISP III covers 62 hectares of farmland with 91 IA members as beneficiaries.
<br><br>
Burgos Vice Mayor Juanito Gacayan asked the IA to love the project for their own good. Likewise, DAR Director Homer Tobias told the farmers that the life of their children and grandchildren relies on how they will operate and maintain the project.
<br><br>
Furthermore, RIM Celeste presented NIA's plan to (help) build offices for the IAs so that they have permanent mailing address and for them to conduct regular meetings as well as administering seminars and/or trainings for the improvement of their association.
<br><br>
Bermudez, on the other hand, said that changing lives through irrigation is what Administrator Padernal expected. She also insisted the importance of irrigation in farming as the primary ingredient in growing the crops. She also told what the administrator expects when he visits-progress in their way of living - big houses and diplomas displayed in their houses.
<br><br>
Finally, Burgos Mayor Jose Abansi expressed his gratitude to NIA, DAR and JICA for providing the project to his constituents. He proudly said that thru this project, the farmers have finally reached third crop in a year. \"Inot-inot, rumang-ay tayo (Slowly, we will progress). Soon, Lower Tumapoc (irrigation site) will be the rice granary of Burgos,\" he ended.

The agreement highlighted the Inter-Agency Coordination Meeting at NIA 6 attended by JRMP II officials and representatives of partner government agencies.
<br><br>
Guests in the coordination meeting included Capitol lawyer, Attorney Dennis Ventilacion, Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF) Environmental Monitoring Team Leader Sang Hoon Lee, and Environmental Specialist, Ronald Muana.
<br><br>
Dubbed as the \"Inter-Agency Convergence Initiatives,\" the MOA laid down responsibilities and obligations of the concerned government agencies.  The agreement primarily identified government projects and programs on infrastructure (hard project component), livelihood and basic social service (soft project components) of the JRMP II.
<br><br>
From establishments of hanging bridges, classrooms, health centers and tribal centers, project listing was firmed up in the agreement.
<br><br>
A priority project of President Benigno Aquino III, JRMP II is envisioned to provide Iloilo year-round irrigation water. As such, some 31,840 hectares of agricultural land stand to benefit alongside the rehabilitation of 22,340 hectares.
<br><br>
Further still is the generation of about 6.6 Megawatts of hydroelectric power and supplement the water supply for domestic and industrial use.
<br><br>
\"This is the ultimate deliverables of our convergence initiative,\" said NIA 6 Regional Manager Gerardo Corsiga. \"Water, power and food...these are anchored on the JRMP II which will now push further economic growth of Iloilo. We all have limited mandates but with this - our convergence initiative, we will be ready for our midterm and longterm responses.\"
<br><br>
To note, the conduct of the second Cultural Community Assemblies in 16 barangays with IP presence established the need for extensive government response.  With NIA's mandate limited, the need for an inter-agency convergence was firmed up.
<br><br>
The MOA covers the direct and indirect impact project areas particularly ancestral domain of the IPs here. Thus the agreement forged between NIA 6 as lead project proponent, the regional offices of National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) and the Department of Agriculture (DA).
<br><br>
Also integral to the MOA is the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).

<br><br>
In a press release issued Friday, June 5, Ilonggo leader and Senate President Franklin M. Drilon reported that Jaro Archbishop Angel Lagdameo has given his blessing and prayers for the successful implementation of the Jalaur River Multi-Purpose Project Stage II (JRMP II). The backing came after Drilon's meeting with the prelate together with Jaro Archdiocese Social Action Center (JASAC) Executive Director Msgr. Meliton Oso.
<br><br>
According to the Ilonggo Senator, the Archbishop said he will \"pray for the success of the Jalaur (JRMP II), and let no one delay it any further.\"
<br><br>
NIA regional manager and JRMP II project manager Engr. Gerardo P. Corsiga, sincerely welcomed the support and said he is thankful to the Catholic leader. \"We are moving forward, now with strong support from no less than Iloilo's highest Catholic leader, His Excellency Archbishop Lagdameo.  We are so thankful,\" said Manager Corsiga. \"The Archbishop's blessing and backing signifies his support not only to NIA but to our farmers, our IPs and all Ilonggos who are looking up to this project as a long-term solution to our problems in water, power and food security.\"
<br><br>
Manager Corsiga further assured that the Archbishop's support will be translated into concrete efforts to ensure judicious implementation of the project, particularly to address concerns of IPs and landowners who will be affected by it.
<br><br>
NIA has recently secured all 16 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for the Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) of the IPs. The FPIC is mandated under R.A. 8371 or the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act (IPRA), a guiding principle in JRMP II implementation.
<br><br>
Also, the project has acquired an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) and has prepared a Land Acquisition and Resettlement Action Plan (LARAP) to address environmental and relocation concerns.
<br><br>
\"We are also thankful to our Senate President Franklin Drilon for his unwavering support to our project,\" Manager Corsiga added.
<br><br>
JRMP II is the first large-scale reservoir dam outside of Luzon. The project is designed to harness the potential of the Jalaur River for multi-purpose use while minimizing impacts to the environment and to the community it covers. It will provide year-round irrigation to 31, 840 hectares of farm land and increase annual rice production from 140, 000 to 300, 000 metric tons. Further, it will contribute to the national rice self-sufficiency target of 7.6 percent.
<br><br>
Also, its 6.6 megawatts hydroelectric power and bulk water component will augment the province's and the city's demand for power and potable water. And finally, the generation of employment opportunities during construction and eco-cultural tourism in the areas it covers particularly the hinterlands of Calinog.
<br><br>
Branded as \"Partner in Progress,\" the project is a much-deserved and much-needed development for every Ilonggo family.","date_published": "2015-06-17","time_published": "14:21:45","date_closed": "2015-12-31"}, {"news_id": 121,"source_id": "B70MQSTT017","source_site": "","publishedBy": "","title": "NIA LEADS CREATION OF MANAGEMENT BODY FOR JALAUR WATERSHED","forpncicid": "No","content": "A Technical Working Group (TWG) for the management of Jalaur watershed area was formed by the National Irrigation Administration Regional Office 6 (NIA 6).
<br><br>
This, as environmental protection and watershed preservation continue to be top priorities of the implementation of Western Visayas' biggest irrigation project, the Jalaur River Multi-Purpose Project Stage II (JRMP II).
<br><br>
In its latest move, NIA convened with partner National Government Agencies (NGAs), Local Government Units (LGU) and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs).  Held Tuesday, created was TWG for JRMP II Watershed.
<br><br>
Present were Mayor Alex A. Centena of the Municipality of Calinog and the Chairman of Jalaur River Basin Management Board, Mayor John H. Tarrosa of the Municipality of Zarraga, Soledad Sucaldito, Iloilo Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Officer, Dr. Jessica Salas of Kahublagan Sang Panimalay Foundation, Inc., Susan Calaor, Be Secure Provincial Coordinator, and Dr. Eva Leal-Lam from WVSU CAF.
<br><br>
With the creation of its TWG for Watershed Management, the meeting also aimed to harmonize the existing plans and programs of upper Jalaur Watershed in relation to the implementation of JRMP II Watershed Management Plan and identify watershed strategies to protect the water quality and quantity while maintaining the productivity for agricultural, commercial and other uses in its watershed area. Another is exploratory discussions with concerned agencies, LGUs and NGOs in consultation with the cultural community and formulation of localized principles for fresh water protection.
<br><br>
Also present were the Municipal Environment and Natural Resources Officers (MENRO) of the 8 municipalities with watershed areas of the province and representatives from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Regional Office 6, DENR Biodiversity Partnership Project (DENR BPP), Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) and Metro Iloilo Water District (MIWD).
<br><br>
Integral to the group is Provincial Environmental and Natural Resources Officer Soledad Sucaldito who presented the existing TWG of Iloilo Watershed Management Council (IWMC).  The roles and functions of the TWG for the IWMC can be adopted into the watershed management plan of JRMP II.
<br><br>
\"The TWG will prepare, implement and monitor the JRMP II Watershed Management Plan (WMP) which is a vital component in the sustainability of our project,\" said NIA Regional Manager and Concurrent JRMP II Project Manager Engr. Gerardo P. Corsiga. \"This TWG will focus on the management of the Jalaur Watershed,\" he added.
<br><br>
In an earlier interview, DENR Regional Executive Director Jim O. Sampulna lauded NIA's efforts to include Watershed Management in its implementation. \"JRMP II is perfect one because of its reforestation and watershed components...other irrigation projects in the entire country do not have these.\"

<br><br>
The General Appropriations Act of 2015 clearly shows that the P11.3-B which former Secretary Panfilo Lacson pertains to is broken down into projects per region with their corresponding budget allocation. The master list of projects is available to the public and anyone is free to scrutinize the 2-inch thick document at the NIA Office. The master list is also published at the NIA website.
<br><br>
NIA's budget went through the rigorous budget preparation process. It starts with all the regional offices submitting lists of projects that are recommended by the Regional Development Councils (RDCs). These lists are then carefully scrutinized to come up with the master list of projects to be included in the agency's budget for a particular year. The budget proposal is then presented to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) during the technical budget hearing and eventually approved by the same office. Further, the DBM requires Program of Work, a documentation which details the plan for each project, before the agency releases the allocation.
<br><br>
The 2015 NIA budget is supported with all the documents that would prove that its budget is above board. It is also a long standing practice of NIA that a separate list of projects is prepared that supports the agency's GAA appropriations. It can be said therefore that all the items in the budget are supported with a duly prepared and approved list of projects.
<br><br>
The only lump sum amount in the NIA budget is the P500-M Quick Response Fund (QRF) for disaster support. This budget can only be utilized for repair and rehabilitation of NIA facilities damaged by calamities and cannot be itemized as the NIA can not foresee where calamity will hit and how much the damage will be. This fund is valid for 2 years, only expiring by the end of 2016 and cannot be converted into a discretionary fund until expiration.
<br><br>
The NIA also denies that there are insertions in its 2015 budget amounting to Php146.235M. This amount is intended for the construction of four projects namely Agno River Irrigation System Extension Project (ARISEP), Dibuluan Irrigation Project (DIP), Bugko Irrigation Project (BIP), and Catarman-Bobon Irrigation Project (CBIP). The agency clarifies that these are \"reprioritizations\" of projects without change in the total NIA budget.","date_published": "2015-07-15","time_published": "10:15:45","date_closed": "2015-12-31"}]
